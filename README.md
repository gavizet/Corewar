## About
Corewar is a 42 School Algorithmic group project, based on the Code War computer game. See [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_War).

As pointed out in the warnings.pdf :
```
COREWAR ISN’T YOUR ORDINARY PROJECT
THE SUBJECT IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE
THE GUY WHO CREATED THIS PROJECT IS INSANE
YOUR CHAMPION WILL NEVER BEAT RAINBOWDASH
I REPEAT COREWAR IS NOT AN ORDINARY PROJECT
THE SUBJECT ISN’T ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING
COREWAR IS DEFINITELY NOT AN ORDINARY PROJECT
```
## How does it work ?

This project can be broken down into two big parts:

__**The assembler:**__
> The program that will compile champions and translate them from the language written them in (assembly language) into “Bytecode”.
> 
> Bytecode is a machine code, which will be directly interpreted by the virtual machine.

__**The virtual machine**__:
> The “arena” in which champions will be executed. It offers various operations (16), all of which will be useful for the battle of the champions.
> 
> Obviously, the virtual machine should allow for numerous simultaneous processes.
> 
> The goal of each champion is to be the last one alive in the memory of the VM, using the 16 possible operations and 'overwriting' other programs.
